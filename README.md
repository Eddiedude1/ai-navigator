# AI Navigator
An AI-First navigator for the site [bunnings.com](https://www.bunnings.com.au) the will find your item of interest and proceed to checkout.
- This POC uses Antrhopic API for AI decisioning
- Currenty built to run on a Unix OS
- Some packages are intentionally downgraded due to the old Mac OS virsion used to develope this project. 
- Python Versio: 3.9.23 (package/hardware restrained)
- Future Improvements: 
    - make application LLM agnostic for testing and fine tuning AI decision making
    - make application OS agnostic for a more seamless user experience
    - update application to use latest package and python versions to stay on the bleeding edge

## Architecture Overview

The AI Navigator employs a sophisticated multi-layered architecture combining advanced AI decision-making with intelligent Cloudflare bypass strategies.

All bypass strategies exhausted

PHASE 4B: AI Navigation Simulation
--------------------------------------------------
Since Cloudflare bypass didn't succeed, demonstrating AI logic through simulation...

Simulation 1: Bunnings homepage with search box
2025-06-29 15:26:30 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
   AI Decision: type 'cordless drill' into the main search box - The search box is the quickest and most direct way to find specific products like cordless drills. Using precise search terms will yield relevant results rather than browsing through categories.

Simulation 2: Search results for cordless drill
2025-06-29 15:26:34 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
   AI Decision: scan and filter search results by key criteria: battery voltage, customer ratings (4+ stars), price range ($50-200), and major reputable brands like DeWalt, Milwaukee, or Makita - Need to quickly identify high-quality drills that represent good value by focusing on the most important specs and reliable brands while eliminating low-quality options. Customer ratings help validate real-world performance.

Simulation 3: Specific drill product page
2025-06-29 15:26:38 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
   AI Decision: click add to cart button - Since we are already on a specific drill product page and the goal is to add a cordless drill to cart, the direct action is to click the add to cart button to fulfill the task
